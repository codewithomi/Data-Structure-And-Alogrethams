What will be the output of the following code?

class Car{
    static int year;
    String company_name;
}
class new_Car {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Car c=new Car();        
        Car.year=2018;              
        c.company_name="KIA";
        Car d=new Car();
        System.out.print(d.year);
    }
}

Ans: 2018


Solution Description:
Year is of static type i.e. only one memory block of year is created , same for every object.
So, it would print 2018.
