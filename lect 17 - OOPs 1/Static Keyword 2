Which line of the following code would generate an error?

class Test{
    static int marks;
    void set_marks(int marks)
    {
        this.marks=marks;               //Line 1
    }
}
class MCQ {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Test t=new Test();              
        t.set_marks(78);                //Line 2
        System.out.print(Test.marks);   //Line 3
    }
}

Ans: No Error


Solution Description
There is no error in this code. In this class, there is just a single variable, which is, static variable. 
Static variables are property of the class, but you can access it through objects. Hence, line 1 and 2 did not generate any error.
