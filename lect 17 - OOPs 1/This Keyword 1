What will be the output of the following code?


class Test 
    { 
        int a; 
        int b; 

    public void set(int a, int b) 
    {  
        b = a; 
        this.b = b; 
    } 

    void display() 
    { 
        System.out.println("a=" + a + " b=" + b); 
    } 
}
class T{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        Test object = new Test();
        object.set(10,20);
        object.display(); 
    } 
} 



Ans: a=0 b=10

Note: Solution Description
When object.set function is called, the local variables are a and b which are passed on to the function as  parameters.

a=10,b=20.
But a has been assigned  to b. That means b comes 10.
Now this.b=b sets the variable b of class Test equal to 10 and a remains
